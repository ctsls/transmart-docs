transmart-docs
==============
Intended as a repository for instruction manuals, usage descriptions, install guides, meeting notes, and the like.
This enables version tracking and change descriptions, as well as supporting distributed editing.
Slightly more version control then a wiki (e.g. branches, merging) and less formating assistance.
