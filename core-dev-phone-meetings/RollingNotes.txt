----- Previous Meeting agenda - 30 July 2013 ------

This Tuesday's Core Developer's meeting will be primarily about organizing the sprints
for the final development of Version 1.1 for release in September. 
Specifically, my proposed agenda is:

  What needs to be done for the release,
  How to conduct weekly sprints,
  What goals are in the first sprint,
  Who is involved in first sprint (taking into account vacations, etc.),
  Schedule for scrum meetings.

For the next six weeks (at least) these phone meetings will largely be dedicated
to the planning and execution of these development sprints.
Onlookers are welcome, of course!

Notes:
	Starting Items:
		Review install process (Zach, Vasu, @ U-MICH)
		JIRA items TBD and assigned
		is anything in ETL/Data loading high priority?
	Tentative plan
		Planning meeting on Tuesday
		Standup/scrum meeting on Thursday
		Where to put notes on activity 
		
	Testing should start with a clean install - also need a public demo version
	Contact original reporting person to see if bug is still a problem (Terry)
	Ask reporting person to demo bug in weekly call and explain problem.

Meeting agenda - 23 July 2013 - VCF loading deep dive

VCF loading experiences
- Question from Alvaro : loading individual level variant data from VCF files
--> e.g. use case: give me all samples/patients that have a specific variation
--> Creating sample/patient sets is problematic anyway in current tranSMART UI
--> Using it directly in R is possible
--> Alexander: Oracle GPL 1.0 SNP loading - data loads but connection with patients is problematic

 * Variant annotations & summary data

GWAS branch from Pfizer uses the following data model
https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp/tree/GWAS/databaseScripts

 * Variant annotations & summary data loading
 
The VCF.groovy script is used to update variant (meta)data / annotations for the GWAS branch
Groovy scripts at https://github.com/transmart/tranSMART-ETL/blob/master/src/com/recomdata/pipeline/vcf/VCF.groovy
--> Purpose is to parse VCF files and inject the variant annotations directly into the DEAPP/BIOMART tables
--> Tables used are DE_RC_SNP_INFO, DE_SNP_INFO, DE_SNP_INFO, BIOMART.BIO_SNP
--> But these tables seem unused in the tranSMART GPL 1.0 codebase (to verify)
--> But they are in the GWAS branch (to be checked)

 * Individual level data

Schema information from https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp-DB/blob/master/VCF_db_scripts/Oracle/variant_ddl.sql
--> Tables a.o. DE_VARIANT_DATASET, DE_VARIANT_SUBJECT_DETAIL, DE_VARIANT_SUBJECT_IDX
--> Seems to be geared towards individual level data connected to patients
--> ETL quite straightforward
--> J&J branch has some functionality but it seems to be limited to exporting data
--> Can we use R interface to leverage this data?
--> Example link to individual level VCF files: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/consensus_call_sets/snps

 * Individual level data loader script
 
Involves 2 steps
--> 1. Perl script to split VCF file into the various tables DE_VARIANT_DATASET, DE_VARIANT_SUBJECT_DETAIL etc.
--> 2. Uses sqlldr to directly upload into Oracle (makes sense because of very large data volumes)
--> Not in GitHub yet - will be soon

Explanation by Jinlei - integration with IGV:
The current transmart code base supports a simple VCF use case with IGV integration. 
The basic workflow looks like this:
 User starts with cohort selection and create a cohort (one or two subsets)
 User selects the IGV in advanced analysis
 User uses the generic filters in the IGV to select variants(SNPs, genes, pathways)
 User click on the IGV button to get the variant view in IGV with VCF data for the selected cohorts

The [vcf data retrieving service]
(https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp/blob/master/grails-app/services/com/recomdata/transmart/data/export/VcfDataService.groovy)
is implemented in the transmart core which retrieves VCF data for a selected cohort 
and genetic filters. It leverages the domain classes that are mapped to the new [vcf schema]
(https://github.com/transmart/transmartApp-DB/blob/master/VCF_db_scripts/Oracle/variant_ddl.sql). 
The IGV integration is implemented in the Rmodules plugin. 
The IGV service class takes care of the IGV session and parameter file generation.

------ previous meeting -------- 9 July 2013	

Meeting agenda:
	Current branches to integrate in 1.2:
		- Main open source branch 'Postgres'
		- Janssen HOTFIX - Faceted Search
		- Sanofi RC1 - New Search page, modifications to Dataset Explorer
		- Pfizer GWAS
	Core API development
		- General infrastructure
		- Clinical Data API
		- High Dimensional API
		- Knowledge Management API
		- Analysis API
		
	Todo items:
		- Faceted Search integration taskforce: Jonathan, Kees, Florian, Ruslan
			--> Ideally resulting in a db and a UI plugin
		- Pfizer branch integration: extract GWAS functionality into a plugin: Ami
			--> Completion planned sometimes in fall 2013
			--> Components: GWAS data model, GWAS UI - extension of Faceted Search,
			    separate tool: Manhattan Plot (GWAVA)
			--> Have to investigate how much this deviates from J&J HOTFIX Faceted Search
		- VCF importer - https://github.com/transmart/tranSMART-ETL/tree/master/src/com/recomdata/pipeline/vcf
		- Sanofi search interface / program-management --> convert to plugin
		- Sanofi changes to Dataset Explorer - seem limited
		- UI overhaul - ExtJS newer versions impose GPLv3 constraints - move to jQuery UI
			--> Faceted Search is using jQuery, also parts of Sanofi branch
		- Oracle->Postgres support :: move towards definitions in Hibernate / Grails Domain Objects where possible,
			and if database-specific optimizations are necessary, separate them in a (database-specific) plugin
		- Continuous Integration environment taskforce: Terry, (Kees)... --> 1 Oracle and 1 Postgres tranSMART instance
			on https://ci.transmartfoundation.org
		- Developer infrastructure: Nexus (https://repo.transmartfoundation.org), Bamboo (https://ci.transmartfoundation.org),
			Stash (https://code.transmartfoundation.org)
			--> Stash is convenient in that credentials are synchronized with rest of infrastructure
			--> But visibility on GitHub is important
		- Core API next steps: start 1.2 alpha branch, rename artefacts, deploy to Nexus

-------------
Previous Notes:

	- discussion of testing
		review of https://ci.ctmmtrait.nl/browse/TM-TMF-22
		types of tests: unit test, integration tests, web tests
		integration testing requires:
			a working public server 
			working pubic test data (for example, the conversion of the GEO data from transmartApp 1.0)
			GEO studies from 1.0 (get accession numbers?)
			Stabilizing the database schema (as grails domain classes)
			ETL for loading data (microarray and clinical working)
			Missing SNP data (J&J working on this)
	- opportunity for GUI testing
		gui test scripts (paper version)
		automation of these scripts (or scripts like them)
		using Selenium: 
		
		
	- review of current efforts

	Umich current unit test; as data is available the integrations test
	Imperial, data loading; GUI interface into test
	

A review of the current efforts
   UMich
*     domain object review (coverage); and unit test; API demo
*     still working on Jira 
   Imperial (and University of Luxembourg on ETL)
	  loading data for search app; may be missing tables!!
		Where does compound and pathway data go (in the database)?
      ETL loading
        focus on clinical data
		currently loading Genomics data
*       This is priority!
		Getting help and data dump from Recombinant (Manish)
 	Problems with user name/configuration tables
*       Ontologies not working on interface
      Work with theHyve on core after Easter
   theHyve
	  ETL - made several corrections to the tables (in PostgreSQL) to support the ETL process
	  Problems with Clinical Data
      coreIntegration branch (working on CRC API)
        i2b2 factored out! (that is "hidden behind the API")
*       implementation of CRC-from-i2b2 involves learning meaning of tables
	some issues surrounding security (needs review!)
          bug exists that hides ontology tree if not admin??
          non-admin users "should" see ontology tree grayed out
	  (in review by Manish; et al)
        Notes on API (CRC):
	  notes can be attached "anywhere"; not used much in current GUI
      problems with postgreSQL with respect to
