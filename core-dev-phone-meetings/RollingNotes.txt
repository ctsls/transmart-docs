Combined agenda and notes; core developers phone call
Noon (16:00 GMT), March 12, 2013

A review of the current efforts
 - expanding unit tests and integration tests (UMich)
 - establishing a test database (ICL)
 	Oracle DB to ProcesSQL (copying tables and data)
 	Problems with user name/configuration tables
* 	TheHyve and ICL will work on this 
 - investigating status of PostgreSQL ETL (ICL)
* 	Recombinant to work with ICL to "get the right schema"
* 		and dump table/db schema to github (postgreSQL version)
 		ETL scripts as well (which are in github?)
 	Seems to be a difference between the schema that the pipe line uses and the DB
 	may work better on the new test data (e.g. copy of Oracle DB)
 	using the postgres branch of ETL github archive
 	get a reference copy of the data base on a shared server (!)
 	version of the database? for dependency matching
 	migration scripts contain schema
 	need to move in the direction of Grails Domain objects (?)
 	some legacy code (pivot.jar, included)  
 - starting work on Core API (theHyve, ICL)
 - others
Discussion of the work on the Core API
 - review of design and early code
 	GitHub: transmart-core-api, transmart-core-db
 	should the APi's be moved to a service level (for example)
 	currently the API is implemented as Java
 		(thus could be mapped to, a service layer, and others)
 - issues arising (e-mail from Kees)
 - identification of tasks for scrum
 	basic functionality: ontology, clinical data, high dimensional data
* 	Ontology data API, being working on by theHyve
* 	CRC data (based on new data) API - ICL
Update/add goals and Identify early milestones
Expand/Create tasks list
Identify and assign (volunteer for!) tasks for current week's scrum push
Review technology stack and make decisions on what to use
 - git hub is wonderful (Yes?)
 - CI site(s)
 	https://ci.ctmmtrait.nl/browse/TM
 - JIRA is ok?
 - Collaboration tools abound
 	JIRA/GreenHopper/Bamboo ... (others?)
 	Skype? Google+ Hangouts?
 	others
Process (phone call, communications, coordination)
