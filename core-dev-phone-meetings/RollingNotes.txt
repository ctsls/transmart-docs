Rolling version of combined agenda and notes; core developers phone calls
Latest update: 11:00EST (16:00 BST), April 2, 2013

A review of the current efforts
   UMich
*     domain object review (coverage); and unit test; API demo
*     still working on Jira 
   Imperial (and University of Luxembourg on ETL)
      ETL resolved; "everything working"; status needed
        focus on clinical data
*       This is priority!
      Test data: Oracle DB to ProcesSQL (copying tables and data)
 	Problems with user name/configuration tables
*       Ontologies not working on interface
      Work with theHyve on core after Easter
   theHyve
      made pull request to archive on ETL; "mostly done"; who is to merge?
      coreIntegration branch (working on CRC API)
        i2b2 factored out! (that is "hidden behind the API")
*       implementation of CRC-from-i2b2 invloves learning meaning of tables
	some issues surrounding security (needs review!)
          bug exists that hides ontology tree if not admin??
          non-admin users "should" see ontolovy tree grayed out
	  (in review by Manish; et al)
        Notes on API (CRC):
	  notes can be attached "anywhere"; not used much in current GUI
      problems with postgreSQL with respect to
        images
	see PULL REQUST at transmartApp
      looking at the "job execution" part of Transmart; Galexy/Chipster as a candidate

Meeting at 16:00-17:00 British Time on Wednesday: deatils of API.

Next tasks (future directions)
  REMINDER: unit tests!
  API for analysis part of dataset explore (including job execution)
    who are the users? workflow? stories? roles?
    plugin framework?
  API high demensional data
  
  GUI improvments
    examination of XJS?
    identify API?
    who are the users? workflow? stories? roles?
      some work on this at BioIT World
    what role SPOTFIRE?
    
  J&J "factered search" integraiton into TrasnmartApp (more information post BioIT World)
  API for search (depends on the update of the search page; and inclusion of the new search)
  

ETL problems
*  missing tables in the postgreSQL versions: Recombinate to follow up
        
      
Major push: the Core API
 - review of design and early code
 	GitHub: transmart-core-api, transmart-core-db
	also see branch on transmartApp coreIntegration !!!
 - identification of tasks for scrum
 	basic functionality:
		ontology (nearly completed), 
		clinical data (CRC), 
		high dimensional data
* 	Ontology data API, being working on by theHyve
* 	CRC data (based on new data) API - ICL
Update/add goals and Identify early milestones
Expand/Create tasks list

Process (phone call, communications, coordination)
 What's working?
 Where are there problems?
 What fixes?
