A review of the current efforts
  UMich
*   API demo
  Imperial (and University of Luxembourg on ETL)
    ETL progress/process - this is a priority
      focus on clinical data
      missing some tables: work with Manish; getting tables into GitHub scripts
   theHyve
*     looking at the "job execution" part of Transmart; Galexy as a candidate
      coreIntegration branch (working on CRC API)
        i2b2 factored out! (that is "hidden behind the API")
*       implementation of CRC-from-i2b2 invloves learning meaning of tables
      some issues surrounding security (needs review!)
        non-admin users "should" see ontolovy tree grayed out
      API for CRC:
        notes can be attached "anywhere"; not used much in current GUI
        problems with postgreSQL with respect to images

Next tasks (future directions)
  REMINDER: unit tests!
  API for analysis part of dataset explore (including job execution)
    who are the users? workflow? stories? roles?
    plugin framework?
  API high demensional data
  
  GUI improvments
    examination of XJS?
    identify API?
    who are the users? workflow? stories? roles?
      some work on this at BioIT World
    what role SPOTFIRE?
    
  J&J "factered search" integraiton into TrasnmartApp (more information post BioIT World)
  API for search (depends on the update of the search page; and inclusion of the new search)
        
Update/add goals and Identify early milestones
Expand/Create tasks list
