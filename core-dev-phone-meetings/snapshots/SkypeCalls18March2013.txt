A review of the current efforts
 - expanding unit tests and integration tests (UMich)
 - creating a three-tier architecture demo, based on core-api (UMich)
 - establishing a test database (ICL)
 	Oracle DB to ProcesSQL (copying tables and data)
 	Problems with user name/configuration tables
 - investigating status of PostgreSQL ETL (ICL)
	is this clinical data and/or micro-array data
* 	TheHyve and ICL will work on this together
	ETL Clinical data scripts compile and run to completion
		tables in database appear to be correct
		using the postgres branch of ETL github archive
 	do we need to set up reference copy of the data base 
		on a shared server (!)
 	which version of the database? for dependency matching
 	note: migration scripts contain current 1.0 schema
 	also, don't forget some legacy code (pivot.jar, included)  
Major push: the Core API
 - review of design and early code
 	GitHub: transmart-core-api, transmart-core-db
	also see branch on transmartApp coreIntegration !!!
 - identification of tasks for scrum
 	basic functionality:
		ontology (nearly completed), 
		clinical data (CRC), 
		high dimensional data
* 	Ontology data API, being working on by theHyve
